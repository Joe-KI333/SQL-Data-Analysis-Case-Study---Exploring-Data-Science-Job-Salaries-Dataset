In this SQL data analysis case study, I explored the Data Science Job Salaries Dataset to gain insights into employee salaries and job trends. 
Through various JOIN queries, I was able to answer business questions such as average salaries for different types of employment, total salaries paid by company location and job title, and more. 
This project allowed me to showcase my expertise in SQL and data analysis, and highlights the importance of utilizing data to make informed business decisions.
